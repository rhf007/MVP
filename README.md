# Weather MVP

My attempt at building a weather web app. Currently, the app is mostly Front-end and further Back-end development is in progress.

## Current Features

* Current weather for the user's location.
* 15-minute interval forecast.
* 6-day forecast
* Other highlights for the current day: UV Index, Rain/Snow Sum, Sunrise/Sunset Times, etc.
* Temperatures displayed in both Celsius & Fehrenheit.

## APIs

* [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/)
* [BigDataCloud Reverse Geocoding Service](https://www.bigdatacloud.com/reverse-geocoding#apilist)
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/documentation)
* [IP-API](https://ip-api.com/docs)

## In The Future

* Searching for weather in other cities.
* Adding weather in other cities into a user specific list.
* Overall bug fixes, code refactoring, and User Experience improvement.
